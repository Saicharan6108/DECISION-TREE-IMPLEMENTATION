Project Overview:

This repository contains the implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree Classifier developed as part of the first task during my internship in the Machine Learning domain at Codtech IT Solutions. The primary goal of this task was to build a machine learning model using the Decision Tree algorithm to classify data and make predictions based on a real-world dataset.

The project focuses on hands-on understanding of supervised learning principles, model evaluation, and model visualization techniques. I chose the popular Iris dataset for this task, which is often used as a beginner-friendly dataset in classification problems. The dataset contains measurements of three different species of iris flowers, with four input features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Objectives:

Understand the working of the Decision Tree classification algorithm.

Apply Scikit-learn to implement a machine learning pipeline.

Train and test the classifier on a suitable dataset.

Evaluate the model using performance metrics.

Visualize the decision tree for interpretability.

Present the analysis in a clean and readable notebook.

Tools & Libraries Used:

The following tools and Python libraries were used during the execution of this task:

Python: The programming language used for the implementation.

Pandas: For handling and manipulating structured data.

Scikit-learn (sklearn):

load_iris: To import the Iris dataset.

DecisionTreeClassifier: For building the classification model.

train_test_split: To divide the data into training and testing sets.

accuracy_score & classification_report: To evaluate the model’s performance.

plot_tree: For graphical representation of the decision-making process.

Matplotlib: Used for plotting and visualizing the decision tree.

Steps Performed:

1. Data Loading
I began by importing the necessary libraries and loading the Iris dataset using load_iris() from sklearn. The dataset was then converted into a pandas DataFrame for better readability and ease of manipulation.

2. Data Preprocessing
Although the dataset required minimal preprocessing due to its clean nature, I created appropriate DataFrames and Series for the features and target variables.

3. Splitting the Dataset
I divided the data into training and testing subsets using an 80-20 split. This was done using train_test_split() with a fixed random seed for consistent results across multiple runs.

4. Model Training
I initialized a DecisionTreeClassifier object and trained it on the training dataset using the .fit() method. The classifier learned patterns and decision rules from the data to differentiate among the three species.

5. Prediction and Evaluation
After training, the model was used to predict the outcomes on the testing data. I evaluated its accuracy using accuracy_score() and generated a comprehensive performance summary using classification_report(), which included precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

6. Visualization
To enhance interpretability, I visualized the trained model using plot_tree(). The visualization displayed feature names, thresholds, and class probabilities at each node, offering insight into the decision-making path of the classifier. This makes it easier to understand how the model reaches its conclusions.

Results & Insights:

The model performed exceptionally well with high accuracy on the testing set.

The classification report confirmed that the model made very few errors in predicting flower species.

Visualization helped demystify the black-box nature of machine learning by showing how the features contribute to each decision.

The Iris dataset’s simplicity makes it a great starting point, but real-world data would typically require more preprocessing and feature engineering.

Deliverables:

A Jupyter Notebook containing:

Full implementation of the Decision Tree classifier.

Performance evaluation metrics.

Visual representation of the tree structure.

Comments and insights on the process and results.

Conclusion:

This task helped me gain a deeper understanding of how Decision Trees operate in a classification setting. It strengthened my skills in data handling, model building, evaluation, and visualization. Through this hands-on experience, I learned how to break down a machine learning workflow into understandable components, which is crucial for future tasks involving more complex models and datasets. This foundational exercise sets the stage for tackling more advanced algorithms and real-world machine learning challenges during the rest of my internship at Codtech IT Solutions.
